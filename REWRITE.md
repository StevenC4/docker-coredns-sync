Explanation of the Structure
	•	cmd/docker-coredns-sync/main.go:
This is where your application’s execution begins. It’s responsible for setting up the configuration, initializing loggers, starting the sync engine, and orchestrating shutdown via contexts.
	•	internal/config:
Replaces your Python config.py. This package will load configuration from files (e.g., YAML, JSON, or environment variables) using a library such as Viper.
	•	internal/core:
Mirrors the original src/core and contains the core business logic:
	•	container_event.go: Contains logic to process Docker/container events.
	•	dns_record.go: Defines the DNS record structure and operations.
	•	docker_watcher.go: Uses goroutines and channels to watch Docker events concurrently.
	•	record_builder.go, record_intent.go, record_reconciler.go, record_validator.go: All handle their specific responsibilities in reconciling DNS records.
	•	state.go: Manages the state of the system.
	•	sync_engine.go: Acts as the central coordinator; may use channels to signal between concurrently running components (e.g., event ingestion, validation, and reconciliation).
	•	internal/backends:
Replaces the Python src/backends/etcd_registry.py with an implementation using Go’s official etcd client. This package will encapsulate all interactions with etcd, ensuring the same registry functionality.
	•	internal/interfaces:
Contains interface definitions that abstract registry access and concurrency locking, much like your Python interfaces. This allows for easier testing and swapping out implementations.
	•	internal/logger:
Provides a centralized logging facility. You might start with Go’s standard log package or a third-party library like logrus for more advanced logging features.
	•	internal/utils:
Groups helper functions for error handling and timing. In Go, these might be simple functions that help keep your business logic clean.
	•	tests:
Instead of a separate directory structure for tests in Python, Go uses test files (ending with _test.go) that reside alongside or in parallel directories. Here they mirror the internal structure and validate that the business logic remains equivalent.

Leveraging Go Idioms
	•	Concurrency with Channels:
For components like the Docker watcher or sync engine, you can define channels to send event data between goroutines. For example, the sync_engine.go might start a goroutine for listening to events and another for reconciliation, coordinating via channels.
	•	Package and Module Organization:
Using the cmd and internal separation aligns with Go best practices, ensuring that internal packages aren’t accidentally imported by external consumers.
	•	Error Handling and Testing:
With explicit error returns and the built-in testing package, you can verify that your business logic behaves exactly as in the Python version.

By adopting this structure, you achieve both business logic parity and refactored code that fully leverages Go’s strengths. Each package has a clear responsibility, and the use of channels for concurrency helps maintain decoupling between components while coordinating complex workflows.

Feel free to ask if you need further details on any specific package or examples on how to implement specific parts (like channel-based communication in the sync engine).
